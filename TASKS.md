## Architecture Decisions

### Python/Node.js Hybrid Structure (2024-01-09)
- Main application is fully Node.js based (Express backend + React frontend)
- Python scripts are used only for development utilities (token analysis, project summarization)
- Decision: Keep current structure as it leverages strengths of each language:
  - Node.js handles all runtime application logic
  - Python handles specialized text processing utilities
- This is not a true hybrid app as Python components are not part of runtime

### PDF Processing Strategy (2024-03-19)
- Simplified to use single pdf-parse library
- Removed pdfjs-dist to eliminate ES Module conflicts
- Benefits:
  - Reduced complexity
  - Better CommonJS compatibility
  - Lighter dependency footprint
