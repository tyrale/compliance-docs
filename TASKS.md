## Architecture Decisions

### Python/Node.js Hybrid Structure (2024-01-09)
- Main application is fully Node.js based (Express backend + React frontend)
- Python scripts are used only for development utilities (token analysis, project summarization)
- Decision: Keep current structure as it leverages strengths of each language:
  - Node.js handles all runtime application logic
  - Python handles specialized text processing utilities
- This is not a true hybrid app as Python components are not part of runtime
