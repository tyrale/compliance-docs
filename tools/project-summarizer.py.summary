- `update_summary`: Updates or creates a summary for a single file if it meets the size criteria.
- `count_tokens`: Counts the tokens in a piece of text.

- `find_critical_details`: Finds critical operational details in the code.
- `analyze_file`: Analyzes a file based on its type.
- `analyze_python_file`, `analyze_js_file`, `analyze_json_file`, `analyze_markdown_file`, `analyze_generic_file`: Analyze files of specific types.
- `generate_summary`: Generates a summary using the Claude API with token tracking.
- `TokenTracker`: A class for tracking tokens.
- `CodeSummaryGenerator`: A class for generating code summaries.

## Critical Details
