purpose: The project-summarizer.py script is a tool that generates concise summaries for code files, leveraging the Anthropic API to analyze the content and provide a high-level overview.

## Structure
The script is composed of several functions and two classes:
- `update_summary`: Updates or creates a summary for a single file if it meets the size criteria.
- `count_tokens`: Counts the tokens in a piece of text.
- `log_summary`: Logs the token counts and savings.
- `should_summarize`: Checks if a file meets the criteria for summarization.
- `find_critical_details`: Finds critical operational details in the code.
- `analyze_file`: Analyzes a file based on its type.
- `analyze_python_file`, `analyze_js_file`, `analyze_json_file`, `analyze_markdown_file`, `analyze_generic_file`: Analyze files of specific types.
- `generate_summary`: Generates a summary using the Anthropic API.
- `TokenTracker` and `CodeSummaryGenerator` classes handle token tracking and summary generation, respectively.
