# Summary
type: python
size: 9.9KB
purpose: The project-summarizer.py script is a tool that generates concise summaries for code files based on their content and type. It uses the Anthropic API to generate the summaries and tracks token usage to avoid exceeding API limits.

## Structure
The script consists of several functions and two classes:
- `update_summary`: Updates or creates a summary for a single file if it meets the size criteria.
- `count_tokens`: Counts the tokens in a piece of text.
- `log_summary`: Logs the token counts and savings, avoiding duplicates.
- `should_summarize`: Checks if a file meets the criteria for summarization.
- `find_critical_details`: Finds critical operational details in the code, such as ports, environment variables, and API endpoints.
- `analyze_file`: Analyzes a file based on its type (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, JSON, Markdown, or generic).
- `generate_summary`: Generates a summary using the Anthropic API with token tracking.
- `TokenTracker`: A class that tracks the token usage to avoid exceeding API limits.
- `CodeSummaryGenerator`: A class that generates the code summaries.

## Critical Details
- Ports: none found
- Environment Variables: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- API Endpoints: none found

## Important Notes
The script requires the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable to be set in order to use the Anthropic API for generating the summaries.
