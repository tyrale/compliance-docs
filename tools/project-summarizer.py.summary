# Summary
type: python
size: 5.9KB
purpose: The `project-summarizer.py` script is a tool that generates concise summaries for code files based on their content and type.

## Structure
The script defines a `CodeSummaryGenerator` class that contains the following key functions:
- `update_summary`: Updates or creates a summary for a single file if it meets the size criteria.
- `should_summarize`: Checks if a file meets the criteria for summarization.
- `analyze_file`: Analyzes a file based on its type.
- `analyze_python_file`, `analyze_js_file`, `analyze_json_file`, `analyze_markdown_file`, and `analyze_generic_file`: Analyze files of different types and generate summaries.
- `generate_summary`: Generates a summary using the Claude language model.

## Important Notes
- The script is designed to work with various file types, including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, JSON, and Markdown.
- The summarization process is based on file size criteria, and the script will only generate summaries for files that meet the specified size requirements.
- The script uses the Claude language model to generate the summaries, which may require additional setup and configuration.
