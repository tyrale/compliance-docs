# Summary
type: javascript
size: 2.2KB
purpose: The `DocumentView` component is responsible for rendering a PDF document within a web application.

## Structure
- The component uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch the PDF document and set up the necessary state.
- The `fetchDocument` function is an asynchronous function that retrieves the PDF document from a specified URL.
- The `onDocumentLoadSuccess` function is called when the PDF document has finished loading, and it calculates the number of pages in the document.
- The `getPdfUrl` function generates a URL for each page of the PDF document, which is then used to render the pages.
- The component renders a `Document` component from the `react-pdf` library, which displays the PDF document.

## Important Notes
- The component relies on the `react-pdf` library to handle the rendering of the PDF document.
- The component assumes that the PDF document URL is provided as a prop or available in the application's state.
- The component does not handle error cases or provide any user interaction beyond rendering the PDF document.
